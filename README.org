** How to Build NDS Music Player
*** Required Packages:
**** Bzr[fn:1]
***** If you branched this from the launchpad repo, then that means you've already got bzr
**** Git
***** You'll need git if you cloned this from github
**** libasound2-dev
**** libao-dev
**** build-essentials
***** This is for only Ubuntu
**** GCC/G++
*** Compiling it:
**** All you have to do is run make to compile it
*** To Install it:
**** Run this in the ndsmusicplayer's folder
***** sudo make install
* *IMPORTANT! READ THIS!*
** If you're using the PulseAudio Sound System
If you're the PulseAudio Sound System, or if you get errors about /dev/dsp not
existing, then you need to use padsp in front of the ndsmusicplayer command.
* Footnotes

[fn:1] This is really optional because you'd only need it if you got
it from Launchpad (via bzr branch) or if you want to update it via bzr pull.
